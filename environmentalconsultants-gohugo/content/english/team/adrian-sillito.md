### About Me

Adrian Sillito qualified in 1983 with a BSc. Honours degree in Geology from Sheffield University in the United Kingdom and in 1991 completed his MSc in Engineering Geology at Natal University in South Africa. His thesis assessed various waste disposal sites in the Kwa-Zulu Natal area.

The first five years of his professional career were spent in the coal and gold exploration and mining fields. Subsequent to this he worked in the geotechnical field for leading companies such as Africon (now Aurecon), the Lesotho Highland Projects Contractors (LHPC) and Kantey & Templer Consulting Engineers. During this time he increasingly focused on the environmental field, gaining extensive experience in environmental impact assessment, soil and groundwater contamination investigation, remediation design and monitoring. Subsequently and in order to cater for increasing market demand, his experience has also extended to Green Star Certification and Carbon Footprint Analysis.

His role as CEO of the company is primarily associated with overseeing efficient project delivery, strategic development of the company and new business as well as training and mentoring the SEC team to achieve their full potential.
