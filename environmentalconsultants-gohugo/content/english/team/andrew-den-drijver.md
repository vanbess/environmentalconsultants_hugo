### About Me

Before joining SEC, he was working on a remote farm in the Limpopo Region for 3 years, managing various projects and a small team of staff. During the time there he has gained experience ranging from irrigation to mechanics and everything in between. At that time, he also discovered his love for the environment and in mid-2020 he joined SEC as a field technician.

His role at SEC currently includes administration support, fieldwork ranging from site clean-ups and remediation projects to underground utility detection.
